# Heat-Exchanger-Network-HEN-Design-and-Optimization

This project demonstrates the design and optimization of a heat exchanger network (HEN) using Aspen HYSYS. The aim is to enhance process energy efficiency by recovering waste heat through proper exchanger configuration and pinch analysis.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** Optimize the configuration of a heat exchanger network for a multi-stream process plant, reducing external utility demands.
- **Methodology:** 
  - Simulate hot and cold streams in Aspen HYSYS.
  - Generate composite curves and identify the pinch point using Aspen Energy Analyzer.
  - Determine optimal heat exchanger sizes, types, and configurations.
  - Evaluate energy savings and perform an economic analysis.
